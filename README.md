### Stage 1/5: Show the code!

Implement two endpoints:

    GET /code that should:

    Return HTML that contains tags <pre> with a piece of code inside and the title Code;
    Respond with a header Content-Type with the value text/html.

    GET /api/code that should:

    Return a JSON object with a single field code that contains the same piece of code;
    Respond with a header Content-Type with the value application/json.
